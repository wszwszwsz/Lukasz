# SVG VIEWER

SVG VIEWER is a web based vector drawing application.


The purpose of SVG VIEWER is to provide a simple and easy-to-use SVG editor experience. It purposely removes some features such as layers and line-caps/corners in exchange for a more simple and pleasant experience. If you are looking for a more complete vector editing open-source solution, please check out SVG Edit [SVG Edit](https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit).
